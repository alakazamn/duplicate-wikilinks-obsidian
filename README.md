# Dedup Wikilinks (an Obsidian.md plugin)

This plugin allows for the conversion of duplicate wikilinks to plaintext.

### Usage

1. Either use the hotkey `Ctrl/cmd + shift + D`, or press `Ctrl/cmd + p` to open the settings dialog and search for `Dedup Wikilinks: Delete duplicate wikilinks from a page`. Just typing in a bit of the command, e.g. "toggle" would likely allow this command to show up via the suggestions the search dialog provides.
2. Repeated links with the same name will be converted into plaintext.
